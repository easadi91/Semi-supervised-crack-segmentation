# Semi-supervised-crack-segmentation
This repository hosts the source code for a semi-supervised crack segmentation project, specifically designed to work effectively with small datasets. The codebase includes implementations of various algorithms and techniques to achieve high-quality segmentation. Before running the implementation, users are required to configure specific settings, such as specifying directory paths for training and validation data. Additionally, certain highlighted portions of the code may need to be modified or customised to fit individual use cases or environments. Documentation is provided within the notebooks to assist in the setup and customisation process.
